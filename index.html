        <h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>I have been an Assistant Professor (UK Lecturer) in the School of Computer Science and Informatics at Cardiff University, United Kingdom since 2023. I am a member of Visual Computing Research Group, which is led by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=V5E7JXsAAAAJ&hl=en">Paul Rosin</a>. I am also a committee member of British Standards Institution. I am participating in the JPEG standardization activities. I am a Senior Member of IEEE (2024, previously Member 2021, Student Member 2019).</p>
		<p>Before that, I studied and worked in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Waterloo, Canada under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O0PjM4QAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhou Wang</a> (FIEEE, FRSC, FCAE, Canada Research Chair) from 2019 to 2023. During the period, I received my PhD degree in 2021, with outstanding thesis award. I used to be a visiting professor at Dalian University of Technology, a visiting scholar at Japan National Institute of Informatics, a research assistant with Intel, a research intern in Microsoft Research and Alibaba Cloud (both with awards). I had an educational background in Electrical Engineering at University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Prof. Zhibo Chen and Prof. Weiping Li (Life Fellow of IEEE, Dean).</p>
	        <p>My research interests mainly focus on image/video processing, multimedia computing, applied perception, human-centric AI, computational photography, imaging, vision, displays, and machine learning. I aim to develop efficient and intelligent visual processing algorithms based on human perception, helping improve the quality of experience for human visual systems. I received the ACM SIGMM Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award (China Section) in 2022 and the Grand Challenge Winner Award in CVPR CLIC 2021.</p>

    	<h3>LION Lab <img style='height: 100px; width: 100px; margin-right: 4px;' src='images/lion.png'/></h3>
		<p> I direct the <a href="lab.html">InteLligent multImedia perceptiOn and generatioN (LION) research lab</a>. My lab focuses on studying different perceptual and generative models in the intelligent multimedia field. Our lab is always looking for talented and self-motivated students.</p>
		<p> Each year, our School has a number of funding schemes to support PhD research (School Studentships). Chinese PhD applicants are also welcome to apply via Cardiff University-China Scholarship Council joint-funded PhD Scholarship. If you are interested in working with me on cutting-edge image processing/multimedia research, please drop me an email.</p>
		<p> Cardiff University (top 1 university in Wales, part of the Russell Group, QS154) is ranked top 5 (<a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&nlp&graph&uk">CSRankings</a>) across the UK in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Natural Language Processing. I have worked with 20 students and extensively collaborated with researchers in both academia and industry worldwide. I will actively recommend my students for internships (Google, Meta, Intel, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba, etc.) and help them establish networking.</p>

        <h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>I have been an Assistant Professor (UK Lecturer) in the School of Computer Science and Informatics at Cardiff University, United Kingdom since 2023. I am a member of Visual Computing Research Section, which is led by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=V5E7JXsAAAAJ&hl=en">Paul Rosin</a>. I am also a committee member of British Standards Institution and EPSRC Peer Review College. I serve as General Chair for the 1st Cardiff Image & Vision Computing Workshop and Chair for the Election Committee of IEEE UK & Ireland SPS Chapter. I am a Senior Member of IEEE (January 2024, previously Member 2021, Student Member 2019), having affiliations with IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, IEEE Signal Processing Society, and IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. I was named in the 2024 edition of the Stanford University list of <b>World Top 2% Scientists</b>. I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA), awarded in 2024/25.</p>
		<p>I was born in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rZwfDmG3K8">Nanjing, Jiangsu</a>, China. Before moving to UK, I studied and worked in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Waterloo, Canada under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O0PjM4QAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhou Wang</a> (FIEEE, FRSC, FCAE, Canada Research Chair) from 2019 to 2023. During the period, I received my PhD degree in 2021, with outstanding thesis award. Previously, I also worked at other institutions such as Japan National Institute of Informatics, Intel, Microsoft Research (with excellent award), and Alibaba Cloud (with outstanding award). I had an educational background in Electrical Engineering at University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1ayDJfsAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhibo Chen</a> and Prof. Weiping Li (Life Fellow of IEEE, Dean, Served as the Editor-in-Chief for IEEE TCSVT).</p>
	        <p>My research interests mainly focus on <b>image/video processing, multimedia computing, applied perception, human-centric AI, computational photography, imaging, vision, displays, and machine learning</b>. I have published over 80 journal and conference papers in these areas. I aim to develop efficient and intelligent visual processing algorithms based on human perception, helping improve the quality of experience for human visual systems. I received IEEE CASS VSPC Rising Star Honorable Mention Award (<b>the first recipient in IQA research field worldwide</b>) in 2024, ACM SIGMM Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award (China Section, <b>1st place</b>) in 2022, and Grand Challenge Winner Award (<b>1st place</b>) in CVPR CLIC 2021.</p>

    	<h3>LION Lab <img style='height: 100px; width: 100px; margin-right: 4px;' src='images/lion.png'/></h3>
		<p> I direct the <a href="lab.html">InteLligent multImedia perceptiOn and generatioN (LION) research lab</a>. My lab focuses on studying different perceptual and generative models in the intelligent multimedia field. Our lab is always looking for talented and self-motivated students.</p>
		<p> Each year, our School has a number of funding schemes to support PhD research (School Studentships). Chinese PhD applicants are also welcome to apply via Cardiff University-China Scholarship Council joint-funded PhD Scholarship. If you are interested in working with me on cutting-edge image processing/multimedia research, please drop me an email.</p>
		<p> Cardiff University (top 1 university in Wales, part of the Russell Group) is ranked top 2 (<a href="https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2019/toyear/2024/index?vision&nlp&graph&uk">CSRankings</a>) across the UK in the areas of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Natural Language Processing. I have worked with 30 students and extensively collaborated with researchers in both academia and industry worldwide. I will actively recommend my students for internships (Google, Meta, Intel, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba, etc.) and help them establish networking.</p>

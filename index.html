        <h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>I have been an Assistant Professor (UK Lecturer) in the School of Computer Science and Informatics at Cardiff University, United Kingdom since 2023. I am a member of Visual Computing Research Group, which is led by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=V5E7JXsAAAAJ&hl=en">Paul Rosin</a>. I am also a committee member of British Standards Institution. I am participating in the JPEG standardization activities.</p>
		<p>Before that, I studied and worked in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Waterloo under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O0PjM4QAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhou Wang</a> (FIEEE, FRSC, FCAE, Canada Research Chair) from 2019 to 2023. I used to be a visiting scholar at National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo), a research assistant with Intel, a research intern in Microsoft Research and Alibaba Cloud. I had an educational background majored in Electrical Engineering at University of Science and Technology of China.</p>
	        <p>My research interests mainly focus on image/video processing, multimedia computing, applied perception, human-centric AI, computational photography, imaging, vision, displays, and machine learning. I aim to develop efficient intelligent visual processing algorithms based on human perception, helping improve the quality of experience for human visual systems. I received the ACM SIGMM Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award (China Section) in 2022 and the Grand Challenge Winner Award in CVPR CLIC 2021.</p>

		<p> I direct the <a href="lab.html">InteLligent multImedia perceptiOn and generatioN (LION) research lab</a>. My lab focuses on studying different perceptual and generative models in the intelligent multimedia field. Our lab is always looking for talented and self-motivated students.</p>
		<p> Each year, our School has a number of funding schemes to support PhD research (School Studentships). Chinese PhD applicants are also welcome to apply via Cardiff University-China Scholarship Council joint-funded PhD Scholarship. If you are interested in working with me on cutting-edge image processing/multimedia research, please drop me an email.</p>
		<p> Cardiff University is ranked top 5 (<a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&nlp&graph&uk">CSRankings</a>) across the UK in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Natural Language Processing. I have worked with more than 15 students and extensively collaborated with researchers in both academia and industry worldwide. I will actively recommend my students for internships (Google, Meta, Intel, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba, etc.) and help them establish networking.</p>
